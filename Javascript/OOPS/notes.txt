object oriented programming - To structure our code
                                prototype
                                new opreator
                                constructors
                                classes
                                keywords(extends,super)

prototype - it is like a template object that all objects inherit methods and properties.
    arr._proto_(reference)
    Array.prototype(actual object)
    String.prototype

factory function - that creates objects

New opreator - creates an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object
types that has a constructor function.

classes - template for creating objects.

inheritance - alllows us to create new classes on the basis of already exisiting classes.
